# Literals

- a value such as a number, character or string
- can be assigned to variables or constants
- hard coded values represented by that value

```c
42
'M'
"Microchip"

i = 42;
#define CONST 7
```

# 2 ways to define constants

```c
#define b 2
const int c = 4

void main(void) {
 int a = 5;
 a = b + c;
}
```
